## IRC

Use your favorite IRC client to join the `#jsonresume` channel on Freenode.  

Or instead, you can use the web client:  [http://webchat.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23jsonresume).

# Getting Started (Local Install)

Install the command-line tool:

```
npm install -g resume-cli
```

# Getting Started (Containerized Install)

Assuming you have Docker installed on your host locally, you can run the utility in an ephemeral container to evoke the `resume-cli` utility. Now you do not have to worry having node installed or any other dependencies to get `resume-cli` up and running. The container by default has the additional [jsonresume-theme-morki](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonresume-theme-morki) theme built in, but you can modify the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfule) to install other themes as well. 

To `resume-cli` simple add the following alias to your `~/.bashrc` file or equivalent: 

```bash
alias resume="docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/data mayankt/resume resume"
```
Remember to `source ~/.bashrc` before running the `resume` command or logout and login again to your shell. 

Try the command `resume init` to see it work. It will save the output `resume.json` in the local directory from where you called the command. 


# Usage

## `resume --help`

Show a list of options and commands for the <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr>.


## `resume init`

Creates a new `resume.json` file in your current working directory.

Complete the `resume.json` with your text editor. Be sure to follow the schema 
(available at http://jsonresume.org).


## `resume test`

Validates your `resume.json` against our schema tests to ensure it complies with 
the standard. Tries to identify where any errors may be occurring.


## `resume export [fileName]`

Exports your resume locally in a stylized HTML, Markdown, or PDF format.

A list of available themes can be found here: http://jsonresume.org/themes/

Please npm install the theme you wish to use locally before attempting to export it.

Options:
  - `--format <file type>` Example: `--format pdf`
  - `--theme <name>` Example: `--theme flat`  


## `resume register`

_Registration is optional._

To publish your resume to your account with a custom domain extension at 
http://registry.jsonresume.org. You will first need to acquire login credentials.

## `resume login`

To log into a registered account. This will allow you to publish with requiring you to reenter your credentials.


## `resume publish`


This command will guide you through the publish process.

Options:
  - `--theme <name>` Style your resume. (Default: `flat`)


## `resume serve`

Starts a web server that serves your local `resume.json`.  

Options: 
  - `--port <port>`
  - `--theme <name>`

If no theme is specified, it will look for the file `index.js` and call 
`render()`. This is useful when developing themes.
